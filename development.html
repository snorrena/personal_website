        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No joke! This Android application predicts surf conditions for the beaches of West Vancouver.</p>

        <p>Even those of you who know me casually should be aware that I became obsessed with surfing at the late age of
            40 something. That fact combined with living a significant distance from a decent break has only made life
            that much more difficult. It has been a humbling experience trying to figure out how to surf. </p>
        <p>I can honestly say that all the time I spent in my youth skateboarding and snowboarding did little to prepare
            me for the challenge. The main problem as I see it is simply an insufficient amount of time spent in the
            ocean catching waves. What can you do? At best, I make it out to Tofino on the west coast of Vancouver
            Island 3 or 4 times per year. Under these circumstances, my progress in the art of surfing has been
            painfully slow. </p>
        <p>The point here is that it is essential to take advantage of every opportunity to surf where ever and when
            ever possible. After all, practise makes perfect.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, on rare occasion, there is surf right here at home in West Vancouver. (Yes! In Vancouver!�.see
            the photo below) This miracle of nature only happens a few times per year and when it does we must be ready
            to go at a moment�s notice. The trick is knowing when to expect waves to hit the shore in West Vancouver.
            This would be the raison d'être for my Android application WestVanSurf. </p>

        <br><br>
        <p>I could tell you that I built this app to exercise some of the knowledge I gained on completion of a tutorial
            series on Restful web services for Android, but truthfully, I think this app was destined from the moment I
            first became aware of how the stars must align to make surf happen here at home. I would build a tool to
            predict Vancouver surf.</p>
        <p> It all has to do with wind fetch. That is to say westerly wind blowing hard across the ocean in the Georgia
            Strait. </p>
        <p>Thanks to the good folks at environment Canada, there is a buoy at Halibut bank in the center of the Georgia
            Strait that transmits data of wind direction, wind speed and swell/wave height to the world wide web in an
            RSS feed (Rich Site Summary).</p>
        <p><img src="images/Haliibut-bank.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="357"></p>
        <p>My app polls the data from this feed and parses the information into usable components. The extracted data is
            then run through an algorithm which calculates the percentage chance for surfable wave conditions on the
            beaches of West Vancouver. The beauty in it is that once the application is up and running, theoretically,
            all I would really need to do is wait for the alarm to go off then hit the beach. </p>
        <p>Praying for surf </p>
        <p>Scott </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For those interested, the following is some technical information on the workings of this application.</p>
        <p>At launch, the app will check for locally stored data before displaying a rudimentary graph of six hours of
            information of wind direction, wind speed, wave height. The display will also blink stored information from
            environment Canada of wind storm warnings and display a temporary pop up message showing the percentage
            chance for surf conditions based on the currently stored data. </p>
        <p>The user will then choose between four buttons to set the audio alarm, check the wind warning forecast, view
            a web camera for live conditions on the beach at Dundarave West Vancouver or clear all stored data in the
            phone and start fresh. </p>
        <p>On first run the app will start a process that checks two RSS feeds every ten minutes. The service will
            initiate an HTTP connection to download the XML file from two environment Canada internet sources. The first
            file is data from the Halibut Bank Buoy. The second file includes information of wind warning and forecast
            weather for the Strait of Georgia north of Nanaimo.</p>
        <p> The XML data from each of these two feeds is parsed to extract pertinent information and saved locally in
            the phones internal storage. As new data records are added from the Halibut bank feed, the old ones roll
            out. The app stores a maximum of six hours of data for user interface display, however, it is only the last
            three hours of data that are used to predict surf conditions. The wind storm warning information is updated
            hourly as each new file is downloaded. </p>
        <p>Surf conditions in West Vancouver are dependent on three factors. 1) Westerly wind. 2) Wind speed. 3)
            Wave/Swell height. The percentage chance for surf is graded using the last three hours of data for each of
            these three criterion. The primary criterion of wind direction is used to filter the data as wind speed and
            wave height would be meaningless for our purpose without westerly wind. Good wind direction is calculated as
            being between 270 degrees west and 315 degrees north west. Wind speed should be at least 15 knots and
            swell/wave height should be 3.2 feet/1 meter. The default final grade is a weighted 30% for wind direction,
            30% for wind speed and 40% for wave height for a total grade out of 100%.</p>
        <p> If the total surf grade hits the % mark set by the user, an alarm will sound (A version of the song WipeOut
            recorded by yours truly) and text messages sent out on a distribution list. The text message is e-mail sent
            to a mobile phone number. </p>
        <p>The text message data includes the calculated percent chance for surf and all information of the current
            report for wind and wave conditions at Halibut bank. I have also programmed a text to speech reader to read
            out the surfgrade. </p>
