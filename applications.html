      <h3>A Minor Blues Primer </h3>
      
    <p>The objective of the Android App A Minor Blues Primer is to get you rocking some Blues guitar solos with a bare minimum of effort.</p>
    <p> First we'll start with a basic lesson on Blues music theory, then we'll move forward to a step by step audio and video tutorial showing you a few awesome solos that will take you gently through a standard 12 bar Blues chord progression. </p>
    <p>Once you are comfortable with the supplied solos, you may review tips and tricks on how to build your own custom riffs and set yourself free to explore your own creative voice in world of Blues guitar improvisation.</p>
    <p> This home school method worked for me, and it will work for you too! </p>

    <h3>West Vancouver Surf Report</h3>
    
    <p>For the  die hard surfer living in Vancouver and starved for waves, the West Vancouver Surf Report application might just provide some much needed relief.</p>
	  <p> It is a rare thing when surfable waves roll in to Vancouver, but when it happens you have to be in the know and ready to roll at a moments notice. </p>
	  <p>This app generates a surf potential grade out of 100% based on a minimum of three hours of data (wind direction, wind speed and wave height) collected from the Halibut Bank buoy in the center of the Georgia Strait. A steady internet connection (Wifi, LTE etc.) is essential to use this program. </p>
	  <p>When running, the app will continuously monitor wind and wave conditions and update the surf grade  as new reports are received.  If the surf grade reaches a user defined score (ex. 80%) an alarm will sound notifying that there may be surf at Dundarave or Ambleside beaches in West Vancouver. </p>
	  <p>The app may be set to  send  a text message report of wind, wave and the calculated surf potential grade to a couple friends.</p>
	  <p>During daylight hours, you may use the main screen button for the webcam to view real time conditions on the beach just north of Dundarave. </p>
	  <p>If the wind is blowing west, set the alarm and pray for surf! The full story on the development of this app can be read <a href="development.html#wvsr">here.</a></p>

      <h1>Java Powered Dynamic Web Applications:</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a href="http://subs2go.ca/" target="new">subs2go.ca</a></h3>
      <p><a href="images/subs2go.jpg"><img src="./images/subs2go.jpg" width="273" height="153" alt="subs2go.ca"></a></p>
      <p>Subs2go is a dynamic web site that will allow users to search a database for last minute substitute fitness instructors.</p>
      <p> The site will host instructor profile information including their specific fitness discipline, credentials and availability.</p>
      <p> Employers will search the database to view information for suitable candidates for hire filtered based on selectable parameters. </p>
      <p>The site will be launched as a repository of fitness instructors teaching Yoga, but will ultimately be expanded to include instructors and trainers in various fitness categories.</p>
      <p>This dynamic web site is being build using Java on the Spring Boot framework including Thymeleaf for the front end view, Hibernate for object relational mapping and MySql as database.</p>
      <p>The site is currently in active development.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>DropInRegistration</h3>
      <p>DropInRegistration is a Java JSP/Servlet application running on a Tomcat web/servlet container.</p>
      <p>This dynamic web application is designed to manage a group of drop in hockey players who play a regularly scheduled game at Britannia Ice Rink at Commercial Drive in East Vancouver.</p>
      <p> The group is made up of 80 or so players who are invited to play each Friday evening. The ideal number of players per game includes  2 goalies and 20 skaters. Also, 4 addional players may be placed on a wait list pending cancellations.</p>
      <p> An email is sent out Monday evening on a distribution list inviting all players to login and register through the web application.</p>
      <p>The login page will screen for correct user identification and passwords. There are also links to allow a player to retrieve or reset their login credentials. Lost passwords are sent to the user at the e-mail address as saved in the database.</p>
      <p><a href="images/login.jpg"><img src="images/small_login.jpg" width="273" height="153" alt="player login"></a></p>
      <p>After a successful login, the user will be presented with a welcome screen including dymanically generated content based on the users current registration status.</p>
      <p> If the welcome page is viewed from a personal computer,  the display content will include a list of all players currently registered to play. The application will render a smaller simplified view for users accessing the site from a mobile device.</p>
      <p>If the user is unregistered, he/she will be invited to join in the next game. If the player is already registered his/her name will be highlighted in the player roster and the instructions and command button will  be changed to prompt for cancellation if the player is no longer able to attend. </p>
      <p>The dynamically generated content includes the specific date and number of days til the next game.</p>
      <p>The application will also present a current  tally of the number of players scheduled to play and others on the wait list.</p>
      <p><a href="/images/unregisteredPlayerLogin.jpg"><img src="images/small_unregisteredPlayerLogin.jpg" width="273" height="153" alt="unregistered player login"></a></p>
      <p>If a unregistered player clicks the button labelled "Count Me In!" he/she will be added into the roster assuming there is space remaining. Currently, the application will accept	registration of 2 goalies, 20 skaters in the roster and 4 players on the wait list.</p>
      <p>Once a player is registered, the system will update the display screen confirming process of the request and display the users name in the roster high lighted in red font.</p>
      <p><a href="/images/registeredPlayerLogin.jpg"><img src="images/small_registeredPlayerLogin.jpg" width="273" height="153" alt="registered play login"></a></p>
      <p>If a player who is already registered presses the cancellation button, the app will remove that player from the roster and return to the login page and display a message confirming the registration cancellation.</p>
      <p> If a goal tender cancels registration, the application will confirm the cancellation and automatically send e-mail notification to the administrator advising that this key position will need to be filled by a replacement.</p>
      <p><a href="/images/registeredPlayerCancellation.jpg"><img src="images/small_registeredPlayerCancellation.jpg" width="273" height="153" alt="registration cancellation"></a></p>
      <p>Also, if a registered player cancels, the application will check for players on the wait list. If there is a player on the wait list, he/she will be moved into the active roster and automatically emailed  with notification of the status change.</p>
      <p><a href="/images/emailPlayerAdded.jpg"><img src="images/small_emailPlayerAdded.jpg" width="273" height="153" alt="player email"></a></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Lastly, the application includes special administrator only pages for management of player data and group email communication.</p>
      <p>The data maintenance page allows the administrator to update, add, delete players and their information as necessary.</p>
      <p>The group email functions will auto-generate emails for the invite to registered for the next game and/or to advise of the current status of the roster.</p>
      <p>That is all.</p>

      <h1>Java Standalone Applications:</h1>
      <h3>West Vancouver Surf Report</h3>
      <p>The West Vancouver Surf Report is a stand alone Java application port of the Android mobile application of the same name. </p>
      <p>This application will run on any personal computer that has Java installed. <em>It </em>performs a similar function as the mobile app of monitor, record and report of ocean data from the Halibut Bank buoy in the Strait of Georgia near Vancouver.</p>
      <p> When the app is running, it will collect and parse hourly data scrapped from a web RSS feed and run through an algorithmn that is used to predict surf conditions on the beaches of West Vancouver.</p>
      <p>An alarm is triggered if the surf potential reaches 80%. </p>
      <p>The graphical user interface for this program was designed using the Java Swing library framework and the data store is on the local hard drive in JSON (Javascript Object Notation) format. </p>
      <p>For a Windows computer, I have wrapped the Java executable Jar  in a Windows exe file using Lauch4j.</p>
      <p>Cheers</p>
      <p>Scott</p>
